Description: # epibox
        
        This package is complementary to the mobile app EpiBOX (available at [EpiBOX](https://github.com/anascacais/rPiInterface)).
        
        Designed for use with Raspberry Pi, it acts as an autonomous recording unit - allowing for sensor connectivity and data storage. EpiBOX mobile app provides the user interaface and the near-real time visualization of the data. 
        
        Currently, EpiBOX supports BITalino-based equipments allowing for the recording, storage and visualization of up to 12 channels simmultaneously. Nevertheless, this package can be easily integrated with other sensors, as long as a python API is provided!
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install epibox.

        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from epibox import mqtt_startup
        
        # this will initiate the process - which should be continued by the user interface (EpiBOX)
